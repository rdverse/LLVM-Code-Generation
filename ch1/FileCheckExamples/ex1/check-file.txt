Notice how free flow text doesn't bother FileCheck.
Notice also that FileCheck doesn't care by default about the number of spaces
CHECK: I    feel
CHECK: great
CHECK: today
Note: there are two 'How' lines; the two CHECKs below match them in order - so need to be in two unique lines (spacing is not strict)
CHECK:    How 
CHECK:    How about you?
CHECK: I don
CHECK: Meh
